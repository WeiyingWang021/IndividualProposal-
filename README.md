Also, ‘N’ number of rounds can be played to finally declare a team as the winner.
The teams with lower average marks are cleared, and remaining teams compete in the next level. 
This process continues in the next round until the winner is declared.

Participants are automatically given questions, and this is based on time limit. 
If the participant is unable to answer the question, negative marking is given.
